## [Jay's COVID Graphs](https://github.com/jwestreich/jayscovidgraphs)
During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I created a [website](https://www.jayscovidgraphs.com) of different graphs to help people understand the status of the pandemic as it was going on. What started as being curious about when states would lift their lockdowns and posting some graphs to my personal Facebook timeline ended up becoming a side passion project. I use R Shiny to host a dashboard that can be accessed by anyone on the Internet.

## [Creating a Business Card in R](https://github.com/jwestreich/business_card)
One of the most valuable skills of a data analyst is being able to use code in creative ways. It's also one of the hardest skills to demonstrate you have if you only have an elevator-pitch amount of time. To solve this, I created a business card while using the ggplot2 package in R. The front of the business card is the visual. The back of the card has the [code](https://github.com/jwestreich/business_card/blob/main/BusinessCard_public.R) I wrote to create the card. A quick way to show someone that I not only know R, but can use it to creatively solve problems.
