## [Jay's COVID Graphs](https://github.com/jwestreich/jayscovidgraphs)
During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I created a [website](https://www.jayscovidgraphs.com) of different graphs to help people understand the status of the pandemic as it was going on. What started as being curious about when states would lift their lockdowns and posting some graphs to my personal Facebook timeline ended up becoming a side passion project. I use R Shiny to host a dashboard that can be accessed by anyone on the Internet.
