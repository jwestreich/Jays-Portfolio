Below are some data projects by Jay.

## [Jay's COVID Graphs](https://github.com/jwestreich/jayscovidgraphs)
During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I created a [website](https://www.jayscovidgraphs.com) of different graphs to help people understand the status of the pandemic as it was going on. What started as being curious about when states would lift their lockdowns and posting some graphs to my personal Facebook timeline ended up becoming a side passion project. I import the data from Johns Hopkins University into R, use the tidyverse to manipulate the data, use ggplot2 to create a series of graphs in a loop, and use R Shiny to host a dashboard of these visuals that can be accessed by anyone on the Internet.

This project led to writing a [guest blog post](https://salthillstatistics.com/posts/79) on the SaltHill Statistics blog.

## [Probabilistic Forecasting to Assess Validity of 4% Withdrawl Rule for Retirement](https://github.com/jwestreich/safe_withdrawl_rate)
Using probabilistic methods to assess the probability of a successful retirement by using the [4% rule](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/what-is-the-4-percent-rule/#:~:text=The%204%25%20rule%20is%20a,subsequent%20year%20for%2030%20years.), instead of the deterministic methods that have been used to justify the use of this rule.

## [Creating a Business Card in R](https://github.com/jwestreich/business_card)
One of the most valuable skills of a data analyst is being able to use code in creative ways. It's also one of the hardest skills to demonstrate you have if you only have an elevator-pitch amount of time. To solve this, I created a business card while using the ggplot2 package in R. The front of the business card is the visual. The back of the card has the [code](https://github.com/jwestreich/business_card/blob/main/BusinessCard_public.R) I wrote to create the card. A quick way to show someone that I not only know R, but can use it to creatively solve problems.
